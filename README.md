Convert Webster's Unabridged Dictionary from Project Gutenberg to OSX dictionary

## Overview

After reading Jason Somers' [excellent article][jsomersDictionary] about
the differences in quality between dictionaries, I was prompted to follow
his method for getting Webster's 1913 into Dictionary.app.

The directions worked as promised, but I was dissapointed with the formatting.
In particular, I was troubled by the hard line breaks at about 80 characters 
and the way that the pronunciation, part of speech, and etymology were not 
clearly separated from the rest of the entry.

To get something more like what I was looking for, I started with a copy
of [Webster's Unabridged Dictionary][gutenbergWebsters] from Project
Gutenberg and wrote this script to convert it to the XML that Apple's
Dictionary Development Kit takes as input.

## If you just want the results

If you don't care to run the script yourself and just want the finished
dictionary, you can download an [installer package][installerPackage]
that will put the finished dictionary in ~/Library/Dictionaries for you.

If you'd prefer to view the dictionary as a [static web site][staticSite]
you can do that too.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a copy of the [Gutenberg document][gutenbergWebsters] and Apple's
Dictionary Development Kit, which is in the "Auxiliary Tools for
Xcode - October 2013" package at 
[Downloads for Apple Developers][developerDownloads]

## Usage

The Gutenberg text should have the beginning and end trimmed off for proper
parsing.  Line endings should also be made to match whatever is standard
on the local machine.

Assuming OSX with a copy of the Gutenberg text in ../29765 and a Dictionary 
Development Kit project at ../ddk_project, this should do the trick:

    tr -d "\r" < ../29765/29765.txt.utf-8 | tail -n +27 | head -n 973878 | \
    ./convert-dsm.pl > ../ddk_project/WebstersUnabridged.xml
